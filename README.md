## Java 8 Features

> **Java 8 (JDK 1.8)**, released in **March 2014**, is one of the most significant and **widely adopted Long-Term Support (LTS)** versions of Java. It introduced several stable features that have since become foundational in modern Java development, particularly in the areas of functional programming and streamlined data processing.

### üìå Functional Interfaces  
Interfaces with exactly **one abstract method**, enabling the use of **lambda expressions** and **method references**. Functional interfaces simplify development by allowing concise and expressive behavior definitions.

- Promotes clean, modular code.
- Examples include `Runnable`, `Callable`, and custom interfaces.

### üìå Lambda Expressions  
Lambda expressions provide a concise way to represent **anonymous functions**. They are typically used to implement the abstract method of a functional interface.

- Enhances code readability and reduces boilerplate.
- Syntax: `(parameters) -> expression` or `(parameters) -> { statements }`

### üìå Stream API  
The Stream API allows **declarative processing of collections** using operations like `filter()`, `map()`, and `collect()`.

- Supports functional-style operations on data.
- Enables parallel execution and lazy evaluation for performance.
- Ideal for transforming, filtering, and aggregating data.

### üìå Method References  
Method references provide a shorthand notation for calling methods via functional interfaces.

- Simplifies lambda expressions that only call existing methods.
- Syntax: `ClassName::methodName` or `objectRef::methodName`
- Used for static methods, instance methods, and constructors.

### üìå Default Methods in Interfaces  
Interfaces can now have **default methods with implementations**, enabling backward compatibility and **interface evolution**.

- Allows interfaces to define behavior without breaking existing implementations.
- Implementing classes can **override** these methods if needed.

### üìå Static Methods in Interfaces  
Interfaces can define **static utility methods** that are accessed via the interface name.

- Static methods **cannot be overridden** by implementing classes.
- Helps in organizing helper methods logically within interfaces.

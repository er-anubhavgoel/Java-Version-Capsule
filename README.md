# Java-Version-Capsule

A Java project that demonstrates **essential Java features** through practical and beginner-friendly examples. This repository aims to provide clean, well-documented code that highlights real-world applications of modern Java capabilities, supporting developers in writing efficient and maintainable software.

## Features Implemented

### ðŸ“Œ Functional Interfaces  
Interfaces with exactly **one abstract method**, enabling the use of **lambda expressions** and **method references**. Functional interfaces simplify development by allowing concise and expressive behavior definitions.

- Promotes clean, modular code.
- Examples include `Runnable`, `Callable`, and custom interfaces.

### ðŸ“Œ Lambda Expressions  
Lambda expressions provide a concise way to represent **anonymous functions**. They are typically used to implement the abstract method of a functional interface.

- Enhances code readability and reduces boilerplate.
- Syntax: `(parameters) -> expression` or `(parameters) -> { statements }`

### ðŸ“Œ Stream API  
The Stream API allows **declarative processing of collections** using operations like `filter()`, `map()`, and `collect()`.

- Supports functional-style operations on data.
- Enables parallel execution and lazy evaluation for performance.
- Ideal for transforming, filtering, and aggregating data.

## ðŸš§ Upcoming Features

The following features will be introduced in future updates, each with **unique examples**, **Javadoc comments**, and **separate interface and class files** for clarity and maintainability:

- **Method References**  
- **Default Methods in Interfaces**  
- **Static Methods in Interfaces**  
- **Optional Class**  
- **forEach() Method**  
- **Date and Time API**

## âœ¨ Highlights

- Each feature includes **2â€“3 clear, beginner-friendly examples**.
- Code is organized with **separate files** for interfaces and their implementations.
